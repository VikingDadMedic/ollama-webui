# HTTPS using Nginx

Ensuring secure communication between your users and the Open WebUI is paramount. HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) encrypts the data transmitted, protecting it from eavesdroppers and tampering. By configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy, you can seamlessly add HTTPS to your Open WebUI deployment, enhancing both security and trustworthiness.

This guide provides three methods to set up HTTPS:

 * **Self-Signed Certificates** : Ideal for development and internal use, using docker.
 * **Let's Encrypt** : Perfect for production environments requiring trusted SSL certificates, using docker.
 * **Windows+Self-Signed** : Simplified instructions for development and internal use on windows, no docker required.

Critical: Configure CORS for WebSocket Connections

A very common and difficult-to-debug issue with WebSocket connections is a misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. When running Open WebUI behind a reverse proxy like Nginx Proxy Manager, you **must** set the `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` environment variable in your Open WebUI configuration.

Failure to do so will cause WebSocket connections to fail, even if you have enabled "Websockets support" in Nginx Proxy Manager.

Choose the method that best fits your deployment needs.

 * Nginx Proxy Manager
 * Let's Encrypt
 * Self-Signed
 * Windows

### Nginx Proxy Manager

Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) allows you to easily manage reverse proxies and secure your local applications, like Open WebUI, with valid SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt. This setup enables HTTPS access, which is necessary for using voice input features on many mobile browsers due to their security requirements, without exposing the application's specific port directly to the internet.

#### Prerequisites

 * A home server running Docker and open-webui container running.
 * A domain name (free options like DuckDNS or paid ones like Namecheap/GoDaddy).
 * Basic knowledge of Docker and DNS configuration.

#### Nginx Proxy Manager Steps

 1. **Create Directories for Nginx Files:**
[code] mkdir ~/nginx_config 
 cd ~/nginx_config 

[/code]

 2. **Set Up Nginx Proxy Manager with Docker:**
[code] nano docker-compose.yml 

[/code]

[code] 
 services: 
 app: 
 image: 'jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest' 
 restart: unless-stopped 
 ports: 
 - '80:80' 
 - '81:81' 
 - '443:443' 
 volumes: 
 - ./data:/data 
 - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt 

[/code]

Run the container:
[code] 
 docker-compose up -d 

[/code]

 3. **Configure DNS and Domain:**

 * Log in to your domain provider (e.g., DuckDNS) and create a domain.
 * Point the domain to your proxy’s local IP (e.g., 192.168.0.6).
 * If using DuckDNS, get an API token from their dashboard.

###### Here is a simple example how it's done in <https://www.duckdns.org/domains>

 4. **Set Up SSL Certificates:**

 * Access Nginx Proxy Manager at http://server_ip:81. For example: `192.168.0.6:81`

 * Log in with the default credentials ([admin@example.com](<mailto:admin@example.com>) / changeme). Change them as asked.

 * Go to SSL Certificates → Add SSL Certificate → Let's Encrypt.

 * Write your email and domain name you got from DuckDNS. One domain name contains an asterisk and another does not. Example: `*.hello.duckdns.org` and `hello.duckdns.org`.

 * Select Use a DNS challenge, choose DuckDNS, and paste your API token. example: `dns_duckdns_token=f4e2a1b9-c78d-e593-b0d7-67f2e1c9a5b8`

 * Agree to Let’s Encrypt terms and save. Change propagation time **if needed** (120 seconds).

 5. **Create Proxy Hosts:**

 * For each service (e.g., openwebui, nextcloud), go to Hosts → Proxy Hosts → Add Proxy Host.

 * Fill in the domain name (e.g., openwebui.hello.duckdns.org).

 * Set the scheme to HTTP (default), enable `Websockets support` and point to your Docker IP (if docker with open-webui is running on the same computer as NGINX manager, this will be the same IP as earlier (example: `192.168.0.6`)

 * Select the SSL certificate generated earlier, force SSL, and enable HTTP/2.

Critical: Configure CORS for WebSocket Connections

A very common and difficult-to-debug issue with WebSocket connections is a misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. When running Open WebUI behind a reverse proxy like Nginx Proxy Manager, you **must** set the `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` environment variable in your Open WebUI configuration.

Failure to do so will cause WebSocket connections to fail, even if you have enabled "Websockets support" in Nginx Proxy Manager.

Caching Best Practice

While Nginx Proxy Manager handles most configuration automatically, be aware that:

 * **Static assets** (CSS, JS, images) are cached by default for better performance
 * **Authentication endpoints** should never be cached
 * If you add custom caching rules in NPM's "Advanced" tab, ensure you exclude paths like `/api/`, `/auth/`, `/signup/` , `/signin/`, `/sso/`, `/admin/`, `/signout/`, `/oauth/`, `/login/`, and `/logout/`

The default NPM configuration handles this correctly - only modify caching if you know what you're doing.

**Example:** If you access your UI at `https://openwebui.hello.duckdns.org`, you must set:
[code] 
 CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN="https://openwebui.hello.duckdns.org" 

[/code]

You can also provide a semicolon-separated list of allowed domains. **Do not skip this step.**

:::

 6. **Add your url to open-webui (otherwise getting HTTPS error):**

 * Go to your open-webui → Admin Panel → Settings → General
 * In the **Webhook URL** text field, enter your URL through which you will connect to your open-webui via Nginx reverse proxy. Example: `hello.duckdns.org` (not essential with this one) or `openwebui.hello.duckdns.org` (essential with this one).

#### Access the WebUI

Access Open WebUI via HTTPS at either `hello.duckdns.org` or `openwebui.hello.duckdns.org` (in whatever way you set it up).

note

Firewall Note: Be aware that local firewall software (like Portmaster) might block internal Docker network traffic or required ports. If you experience issues, check your firewall rules to ensure necessary communication for this setup is allowed.

### Let's Encrypt

Let's Encrypt provides free SSL certificates trusted by most browsers, ideal for securing your production environment. 🔐

This guide uses a two-phase approach:

 1. **Phase 1:** Temporarily run Nginx to prove you own the domain and get a certificate from Let's Encrypt.
 2. **Phase 2:** Reconfigure Nginx to use the new certificate for a secure HTTPS connection.

#### Prerequisites

 * A **domain name** (e.g., `my-webui.com`) with a **DNS`A` record** pointing to your server's public IP address.
 * **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your server.
 * Basic understanding of running commands in a terminal.

info

**Heads up!** Let's Encrypt **cannot** issue certificates for an IP address. You **must** use a domain name.

* * *

### Step 1: Initial Setup for Certificate Validation

First, we'll set up the necessary files and a temporary Nginx configuration that allows Let's Encrypt's servers to verify your domain.

 1. **Make sure you followed thePrerequisites above.**

 2. **Create the Directory Structure**

From your project's root directory, run this command to create folders for your Nginx configuration and Let's Encrypt certificates:
[code] mkdir -p nginx/conf.d ssl/certbot/conf ssl/certbot/www 

[/code]

 3. **Create a Temporary Nginx Configuration**

Create the file `nginx/conf.d/open-webui.conf`. This initial config only listens on port 80 and serves the validation files for Certbot.

⚠️ **Remember to replace`<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>`** with your actual domain.
[code] # nginx/conf.d/open-webui.conf 

 server { 
 listen 80; 
 listen [::]:80; 
 server_name <YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>; 

 # Route for Let's Encrypt validation challenges 
 location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ { 
 root /var/www/certbot; 
 } 

 # All other requests will be ignored for now 
 location / { 
 return 404; 
 } 
 } 

[/code]

 4. **Update Your`docker-compose.yml`**

Add the `nginx` service to your `docker-compose.yml` and ensure your `open-webui` service is configured to use the shared Docker network.
[code] services: 
 nginx: 
 image: nginx:alpine 
 restart: always 
 ports: 
 # Expose HTTP and HTTPS ports to the host machine 
 - "80:80" 
 - "443:443" 
 volumes: 
 # Mount Nginx configs and SSL certificate data 
 - ./nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d 
 - ./ssl/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt 
 - ./ssl/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot 
 depends_on: 
 - open-webui 
 networks: 
 - open-webui-network 

 open-webui: 
 # Your existing open-webui configuration... 
 # ... 
 # Ensure it's on the same network 
 networks: 
 - open-webui-network 
 # Expose the port internally to the Docker network. 
 # You do NOT need to publish it to the host (e.g., no `ports` section is needed here). 
 expose: 
 - 8080 

 networks: 
 open-webui-network: 
 driver: bridge 

[/code]

* * *

### Step 2: Obtain the SSL Certificate

Now we'll run a script that uses Docker to fetch the certificate.

 1. **Create the Certificate Request Script**

Create an executable script named `enable_letsencrypt.sh` in your project root.

⚠️ **Remember to replace`<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>` and `<YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>`** with your actual information.
[code] #!/bin/bash 
 # enable_letsencrypt.sh 

 DOMAIN="<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>" 
 EMAIL="<YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>" 

 echo "### Obtaining SSL certificate for $DOMAIN ###" 

 # Start Nginx to serve the challenge 
 docker compose up -d nginx 

 # Run Certbot in a container to get the certificate 
 docker run --rm \ 
 -v "./ssl/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt" \ 
 -v "./ssl/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot" \ 
 certbot/certbot certonly \ 
 --webroot \ 
 --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot \ 
 --email "$EMAIL" \ 
 --agree-tos \ 
 --no-eff-email \ 
 --force-renewal \ 
 -d "$DOMAIN" 

 if [[ $? != 0 ]]; then 
 echo "Error: Failed to obtain SSL certificate." 
 docker compose stop nginx 
 exit 1 
 fi 

 # Stop Nginx before we apply the final config 
 docker compose stop nginx 
 echo "### Certificate obtained successfully! ###" 

[/code]

 2. **Make the Script Executable**
[code] chmod +x enable_letsencrypt.sh 

[/code]

 3. **Run the Script**

Execute the script. It will automatically start Nginx, request the certificate, and then stop Nginx.
[code] ./enable_letsencrypt.sh 

[/code]

* * *

### Important: Caching Configuration

When using NGINX with Open WebUI, proper caching is crucial for performance while ensuring authentication remains secure. The configuration below includes:

 * **Cached** : Static assets (CSS, JS, fonts, images) for better performance
 * **Not Cached** : Authentication endpoints, API calls, SSO/OAuth callbacks, and session data
 * **Result** : Faster page loads without breaking login functionality

The configuration below implements these rules automatically.

### Step 3: Finalize Nginx Configuration for HTTPS

With the certificate saved in your `ssl` directory, you can now update the Nginx configuration to enable HTTPS.

 1. **Update the Nginx Configuration for SSL**

**Replace the entire contents** of `nginx/conf.d/open-webui.conf` with the final configuration below.

⚠️ **Replace all 4 instances of`<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>`** with your domain.
[code] # nginx/conf.d/open-webui.conf 

 # Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS 
 server { 
 listen 80; 
 listen [::]:80; 
 server_name <YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>; 

 location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ { 
 root /var/www/certbot; 
 } 

 location / { 
 return 301 https://$host$request_uri; 
 } 
 } 

 server { 
 listen 443 ssl; 
 listen [::]:443 ssl; 
 http2 on; 
 server_name <YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>; 

 ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/fullchain.pem; 
 ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/privkey.pem; 

 ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; 
 ssl_ciphers 'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256'; 
 ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off; 

 location ~* ^/(auth|api|oauth|admin|signin|signup|signout|login|logout|sso)/ { 
 proxy_pass http://open-webui:8080; 
 proxy_http_version 1.1; 
 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; 
 proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade"; 
 proxy_set_header Host $host; 
 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; 
 proxy_read_timeout 10m; 
 proxy_buffering off; 
 client_max_body_size 20M; 

 proxy_no_cache 1; 
 proxy_cache_bypass 1; 
 add_header Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=0" always; 
 add_header Pragma "no-cache" always; 
 expires -1; 
 } 

 location ~* \.(css|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)$ { 
 proxy_pass http://open-webui:8080; 
 proxy_http_version 1.1; 
 proxy_set_header Host $host; 
 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; 

 # Cache static assets for 7 days 
 expires 7d; 
 add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable"; 
 } 

 location / { 
 proxy_pass http://open-webui:8080; 
 proxy_http_version 1.1; 
 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; 
 proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade"; 
 proxy_set_header Host $host; 
 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; 
 proxy_read_timeout 10m; 
 proxy_buffering off; 
 client_max_body_size 20M; 

 add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=300, must-revalidate"; 
 } 
 } 

[/code]

 2. **Launch All Services**

Start both Nginx and Open WebUI with the final, secure configuration.
[code] docker compose up -d 

[/code]

* * *

### Step 4: Access Your Secure WebUI

You can now access your Open WebUI instance securely via HTTPS.

➡️ **`https://<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>`**

* * *

### (Optional) Step 5: Setting Up Automatic Renewal

Let's Encrypt certificates expire every 90 days. You should set up a `cron` job to renew them automatically.

 1. Open the crontab editor:
[code] sudo crontab -e 

[/code]

 2. Add the following line to run a renewal check every day at 3:30 AM. It will only renew if the certificate is close to expiring.
[code] 30 3 * * * /usr/bin/docker run --rm -v "<absolute_path>/ssl/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt" -v "<absolute_path>/ssl/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot" certbot/certbot renew --quiet --webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot --deploy-hook "/usr/bin/docker compose -f <absolute_path>/docker-compose.yml restart nginx" 

[/code]

### Self-Signed Certificate

Using self-signed certificates is suitable for development or internal use where trust is not a critical concern.

#### Self-Signed Certificate Steps

 1. **Create Directories for Nginx Files:**
[code] mkdir -p conf.d ssl 

[/code]

 2. **Create Nginx Configuration File:**

**`conf.d/open-webui.conf`:**
[code] server { 
 listen 443 ssl; 
 server_name your_domain_or_IP; 

 ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt; 
 ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key; 
 ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; 

 location ~* ^/(auth|api|oauth|admin|signin|signup|signout|login|logout|sso)/ { 
 proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:3000; 

 proxy_http_version 1.1; 
 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; 
 proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade"; 

 proxy_set_header Host $host; 
 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; 

 proxy_buffering off; 
 client_max_body_size 20M; 
 proxy_read_timeout 10m; 

 # Disable caching for auth endpoints 
 proxy_no_cache 1; 
 proxy_cache_bypass 1; 
 add_header Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate" always; 
 expires -1; 
 } 

 location ~* \.(css|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)$ { 
 proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:3000; 
 proxy_http_version 1.1; 
 proxy_set_header Host $host; 

 expires 7d; 
 add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable"; 
 } 

 location / { 
 proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:3000; 

 proxy_http_version 1.1; 
 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; 
 proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade"; 

 proxy_set_header Host $host; 
 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; 

 proxy_buffering off; 

 client_max_body_size 20M; 
 proxy_read_timeout 10m; 

 add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=300, must-revalidate"; 
 } 
 } 

[/code]

 3. **Generate Self-Signed SSL Certificates:**
[code] openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \ 
 -keyout ssl/nginx.key \ 
 -out ssl/nginx.crt \ 
 -subj "/CN=your_domain_or_IP" 

[/code]

 4. **Update Docker Compose Configuration:**

Add the Nginx service to your `docker-compose.yml`:
[code] services: 
 nginx: 
 image: nginx:alpine 
 ports: 
 - "443:443" 
 volumes: 
 - ./conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d 
 - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl 
 depends_on: 
 - open-webui 

[/code]

 5. **Start Nginx Service:**
[code] docker compose up -d nginx 

[/code]

#### Access the WebUI

Access Open WebUI via HTTPS at:

<https://your_domain_or_IP>

* * *

### Using a Self-Signed Certificate and Nginx on Windows without Docker

For basic internal/development installations, you can use nginx and a self-signed certificate to proxy Open WebUI to https, allowing use of features such as microphone input over LAN. (By default, most browsers will not allow microphone input on insecure non-localhost urls)

This guide assumes you installed Open WebUI using pip and are running `open-webui serve`

#### Step 1: Installing openssl for certificate generation

You will first need to install openssl

You can download and install precompiled binaries from the [Shining Light Productions (SLP)](<https://slproweb.com/>) website.

Alternatively, if you have [Chocolatey](<https://chocolatey.org/>) installed, you can use it to install OpenSSL quickly:

 1. Open a command prompt or PowerShell.

 2. Run the following command to install OpenSSL:
[code] choco install openssl -y 

[/code]

* * *

### **Verify Installation**

After installation, open a command prompt and type:
[code] 
 openssl version 

[/code]

If it displays the OpenSSL version (e.g., `OpenSSL 3.x.x ...`), it is installed correctly.

#### Step 2: Installing nginx

Download the official Nginx for Windows from [nginx.org](<https://nginx.org>) or use a package manager like Chocolatey. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory (e.g., C:\nginx).

#### Step 3: Generate certificate

Run the following command:
[code] 
 openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout nginx.key -out nginx.crt 

[/code]

Move the generated nginx.key and nginx.crt files to a folder of your choice, or to the C:\nginx directory

#### Step 4: Configure nginx

Open C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf in a text editor

If you want Open WebUI to be accessible over your local LAN, be sure to note your LAN ip address using `ipconfig` e.g., 192.168.1.15

Set it up as follows:
[code] 

 #user nobody; 
 worker_processes 1; 

 #error_log logs/error.log; 

 #error_log logs/error.log notice; 

 #error_log logs/error.log info; 

 #pid logs/nginx.pid; 

 events { 
 worker_connections 1024; 
 } 

 http { 
 include mime.types; 
 default_type application/octet-stream; 

 sendfile on; 
 keepalive_timeout 120; 

 map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade { 
 default upgrade; 
 '' close; 
 } 

 server { 
 listen 80; 
 server_name 192.168.1.15; 

 return 301 https://$host$request_uri; 
 } 

 server { 
 listen 443 ssl; 
 server_name 192.168.1.15; 

 ssl_certificate C:\\nginx\\nginx.crt; 
 ssl_certificate_key C:\\nginx\\nginx.key; 
 ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; 
 ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256; 
 ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; 

 location ~* ^/(auth|api|oauth|admin|signin|signup|signout|login|logout|sso)/ { 
 proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; 

 proxy_http_version 1.1; 
 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; 
 proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade; 

 proxy_set_header Host $host; 
 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; 

 proxy_buffering off; 
 client_max_body_size 20M; 
 proxy_read_timeout 10m; 

 add_header Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate" always; 
 expires -1; 
 } 

 location ~* \.(css|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)$ { 
 proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; 
 proxy_http_version 1.1; 
 proxy_set_header Host $host; 

 expires 7d; 
 add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable"; 
 } 

 location / { 
 proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; 

 proxy_http_version 1.1; 
 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; 
 proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade; 

 proxy_set_header Host $host; 
 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; 
 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; 

 proxy_buffering off; 
 client_max_body_size 20M; 
 proxy_read_timeout 10m; 

 add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=300, must-revalidate"; 
 } 
 } 
 } 

[/code]

Save the file, and check the configuration has no errors or syntax issues by running `nginx -t`. You may need to `cd C:\nginx` first depending on how you installed it

Run nginx by running `nginx`. If an nginx service is already started, you can reload new config by running `nginx -s reload`

* * *

You should now be able to access Open WebUI on <https://192.168.1.15> (or your own LAN ip as appropriate). Be sure to allow windows firewall access as needed.

## Next Steps

After setting up HTTPS, access Open WebUI securely at:

 * <https://localhost>

Ensure that your DNS records are correctly configured if you're using a domain name. For production environments, it's recommended to use Let's Encrypt for trusted SSL certificates.
