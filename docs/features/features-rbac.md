# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Access Control

 * [‍🔑 Roles](</features/rbac/roles>) \- The roles defined in Open WebUI
 * [‍🔐 Groups](</features/rbac/groups>) \- Setup groups of users to share access to resources
 * [🔒 Permissions](</features/rbac/permissions>) \- Configure access controls and feature availability

Roles, groups and permissions are designed to work together to provide a finegrained model for controlling user access to individual resources.
