 2. After the response has finished, you can click the Picture icon to generate an image.
 3. After the image has finished generating, it will be returned automatically in chat.

tip

You can also edit the LLM's response and enter your image generation prompt as the message to send off for image generation instead of using the actual response provided by the LLM.
