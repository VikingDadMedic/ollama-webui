# Starting with Llama.cpp

## Overview

Open WebUI makes it simple and flexible to connect and manage a local Llama.cpp server to run efficient, quantized language models. Whether you’ve compiled Llama.cpp yourself or you're using precompiled binaries, this guide will walk you through how to:

 * Set up your Llama.cpp server
 * Load large models locally
 * Integrate with Open WebUI for a seamless interface

Let’s get you started!

* * *

## Step 1: Install Llama.cpp

To run models with Llama.cpp, you first need the Llama.cpp server installed locally.

You can either:

 * 📦 [Download prebuilt binaries](<https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases>)
 * 🛠️ Or build it from source by following the [official build instructions](<https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/build.md>)

After installing, make sure `llama-server` is available in your local system path or take note of its location.

* * *

## Step 2: Download a Supported Model

You can load and run various GGUF-format quantized LLMs using Llama.cpp. One impressive example is the DeepSeek-R1 1.58-bit model optimized by UnslothAI. To download this version:

 1. Visit the [Unsloth DeepSeek-R1 repository on Hugging Face](<https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF>)
 2. Download the 1.58-bit quantized version – around 131GB.

Alternatively, use Python to download programmatically:
[code] 

 # pip install huggingface_hub hf_transfer 

 from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download 

 snapshot_download( 
 repo_id = "unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF", 
 local_dir = "DeepSeek-R1-GGUF", 
 allow_patterns = ["*UD-IQ1_S*"], # Download only 1.58-bit variant 
 ) 

[/code]

This will download the model files into a directory like:
[code] 
 DeepSeek-R1-GGUF/ 
 └── DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S/ 
 ├── DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S-00001-of-00003.gguf 
 ├── DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S-00002-of-00003.gguf 
 └── DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S-00003-of-00003.gguf 

[/code]

📍 Keep track of the full path to the first GGUF file — you’ll need it in Step 3.

* * *

## Step 3: Serve the Model with Llama.cpp

Start the model server using the llama-server binary. Navigate to your llama.cpp folder (e.g., build/bin) and run:
[code] 
 ./llama-server \ 
 --model /your/full/path/to/DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S-00001-of-00003.gguf \ 
 --port 10000 \ 
 --ctx-size 1024 \ 
 --n-gpu-layers 40 

[/code]

🛠️ Tweak the parameters to suit your machine:

 * \--model: Path to your .gguf model file
 * \--port: 10000 (or choose another open port)
 * \--ctx-size: Token context length (can increase if RAM allows)
 * \--n-gpu-layers: Layers offloaded to GPU for faster performance

Once the server runs, it will expose a local OpenAI-compatible API on:
[code] 
 http://127.0.0.1:10000 

[/code]

* * *

## Step 4: Connect Llama.cpp to Open WebUI

To control and query your locally running model directly from Open WebUI:

 1. Open Open WebUI in your browser
 2. Go to ⚙️ Admin Settings → Connections → OpenAI Connections
 3. Click ➕ Add Connection and enter:

 * URL: `http://127.0.0.1:10000/v1` (Or use `http://host.docker.internal:10000/v1` if running WebUI inside Docker)
 * API Key: `none` (leave blank)

💡 Once saved, Open WebUI will begin using your local Llama.cpp server as a backend!

## Quick Tip: Try Out the Model via Chat Interface

Once connected, select the model from the Open WebUI chat menu and start interacting!

## You're Ready to Go!

Once configured, Open WebUI makes it easy to:

 * Manage and switch between local models served by Llama.cpp
 * Use the OpenAI-compatible API with no key needed
 * Experiment with massive models like DeepSeek-R1 — right from your machine!

🚀 Have fun experimenting and building!
